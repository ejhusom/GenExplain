"""GenExplain - Explainability module.

This module provides the functionality to generate explanations for system
adaptations based on log entries. It is intended to be used as a part of the
inGen system, which is a conversational AI system that can adapt to user
feedback.

    """Generate explanations for actions and adaptations made by AI agents.

    GenExplain is a Python framework designed to generate human-understandable
    explanations for a series of actions, events, or decisions. These actions
    could originate from AI agents, machine learning models, or even sequences
    in a complex system. The goal is to provide clear, context-aware
    explanations that help users understand why a specific sequence of events
    occurred.

    The framework is centered around the concept of **Intent-based Computing**,
    where actions are driven by high-level intents or objectives. By tracing
    the reasoning behind each action, GenExplain aims to reveal the complex
    decision-making processes and enhance transparency in AI systems.

    GenExplain employs a set of interacting LLM (Large Language Model) agents
    to generate explanations based on input data and contextual information.
    These agents can leverage pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT-4) or
    domain-specific models to collaboratively generate explanations tailored to
    different audiences or applications. The interaction between multiple LLM
    agents allows the framework to reason about diverse factors and arrive at
    coherent, multi-layered explanations.
